After setting up the **al-folio** Jekyll theme, this site is finally live!

This space will mainly cover my research updates, selected publications, and notes on topics I'm exploring — from reinforcement learning to optimization and Physical AI.

The site is still under construction, but you can expect more content soon:
- 📄 Research highlights and publication summaries  
- 🧠 Notes on learning and experiments  
- 🛠️ Occasional engineering or system tips  

Stay tuned!
